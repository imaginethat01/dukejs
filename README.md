This one works well. I'm kind of surprised actually. 

Just install the game. The DOS installer adds to the charm. It takes a second to install - this just adds to the authenticity of the expirience.

<h2>For those of you who are not used to DOS</h2>

<h4>Simply let the Game Install (Yes, I know it takes a while. That's how things were.)</h4>
<h4>Once Setup is Complete type in NUKEM2.EXE" - The game should start</h4>

HEADPHONE WARNING : The audio takes a second to kick in and may crackle loudly when first starting.
